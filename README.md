# Executive Summary
The hospital’s purpose is to deliver high-quality, accessible, and patient-centered care while ensuring sustainable operations. An analysis of one hundred and twenty patient visits revealed important patterns in demographics, visit types, severity, and costs. Dermatology recorded the highest number of visits, while Neurology generated the highest revenue per visit. Although emergency visits were fewer, they carried significantly higher costs. Male and female patients were almost evenly represented, while age distribution showed that seniors and children accounted for the largest share of visits. Monthly trends showed fluctuations, with peaks in March and September, highlighting the importance of aligning resources with demand.

# Business Understanding
The hospital is currently challenged by varying demand across departments, the high cost of emergency visits, and demographic factors such as age and gender that strongly influence visit trends. Without a clear understanding of these patterns, it becomes difficult to allocate resources efficiently, improve patient care, and ensure long-term financial stability.

# Data Understanding
The analysis was based on one hundred and twenty hospital visits from fifty-four patients. Data captured included patient demographics, department of consultation, visit type, severity of case, and cost. These records were carefully processed, cleaned, and structured to support meaningful insights into patient flow and resource utilization.

# Methodology
Hospital visit records were first collected and standardized to remove errors and inconsistencies. Age groups and months were categorized to reveal patterns across demographics and time. Metrics were aggregated to show visits by department, gender, age, and cost. Finally, the dataset was visualized and analyzed using Power BI to uncover performance trends and actionable insights.

# Key Insights 

Dermatology attracted the largest patient volume, while Neurology provided the highest revenue per visit.

Female patients slightly outnumbered male patients (63 vs 57).

Seniors (51+) and children (0–18) dominated both overall visits and emergency cases.

Dermatology, Cardiology, and Pediatrics carried the highest treatment costs.

Patient visits and costs peaked in March and September, revealing strong seasonal patterns.

# Recommendations

Expand geriatric and pediatric care services.

Strengthen emergency readiness through improved staff training and equipment.

Increase staffing and resources in Dermatology and Neurology to meet demand.

Prepare medicines, supplies, and schedules ahead of peak months (March and September).

Review high-cost treatments and negotiate with suppliers to improve efficiency.

# Conclusion
The hospital patient visit analysis highlights the importance of strengthening geriatric and emergency services, optimizing the balance between high-demand and high-revenue departments, and preparing for seasonal fluctuations in visits and costs. By acting on these priorities, the hospital will not only improve patient outcomes but also enhance operational efficiency and maintain long-term financial sustainability.
